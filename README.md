As a moderate conservatie in todays society, the state of the 2016 race has left me, and I assume others, depressed and without much faith in the party whose race resembles a circus more than something out of the party of Lincoln, Reagan, and Jefferson. This site attempts to remind conservatives that there are people that share their values and work to extend the American dream. This site is meant to reigite faith in the GOP and help strengthen it in the future, and honor the campaign and ideals of Marco Rubio.
