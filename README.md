As a moderate conservatie in todays society, the state of the 2016 race has left me, and I assume others, depressed and without much faith in the party whose race resembles a circus more than something out of the party of Lincoln, Reagan, and Jefferson. This site attempts to remind conservatives that there are people that share their values and work to extend the American dream.
