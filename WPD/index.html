    <h1>Marco Rubio should be president </h1>
    <p>Why this man has the expierience and drive necessary to become president and why he, and the country, needs your help. </p>

    <h2>Current Standing in the Republican Primary</h2>
    <p>Marco Rubio has now suspended his campaign and, despite a setback with Chris Christie, has placed 2nd and 3rd in multiple primaries and 1rst in  Minnesota and Puerto Rico. He had long been known to be many Republicans second choice, as evangelicals and Tea Party conservatives lean toward Cruz and  moderates lean toward John Kasich.</p>
    <h3>Personal Qualities</h3>
    <p>Marco Rubio has many quallities that made him a great choice for president...</p>
    <ol>
      <li>He's able to grow from failure. At the New Hampshire debates in early Febuary, it was a dark time for Rubio. After a bad exchange with Chris Christie where he repeated himself, so bad it was compared to Rick Perry forgetting his three things, he was called the Marcobot by the media and had democratic people coming to his rallies in robot costumes. These attacks, spurred by the media, worked and caused Rubio to get 5th place in New Hampshire. Lesser men would have given up after their momentum had seeminglly vanished, but Rubio came back swinging and jumped from 5th to 2nd in South Carolina. It says something about his character that he could rebound from this. </li>
      <li>He has experience. Rubio has worked for 4 and a half years as a senator from Florida and, despite the argument that America needs someone who has no or little connection to government, these years have left him well expierienced in security, immigration, forgien policy. Although people don't realize it, Rubio has spent 16 years in public office, which is 4 times Cruz's expierience and more than other canidate except Kasich. </li>
      <li>He's adaptable. About a week ago, in order to keep his campaign alive, Rubio did the only thing he could to compete with Trump, sunk to his level. Rubio has made comments on Trumps spray tan, the &quot;size of his hands&quot;, and many other scathing personal attacks. The result, Rubio has been taking away Trump's airtime on the news, won Minnesota, and has made more headway against Trump then ever before. </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Electability</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Rubio is the only canidate that trumped Trump in debate topics like healthcare and others</li>
      <li>In national polls (cnn, fox, USA Today) he is the only canidate other than John Kasich to win repeatebly against Hillary Clinton.</li>
    </ol>
