      <h1>Marco Rubio's best lines </h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Someone convinced you (Jeb) attacking me is going to help you.</li>
      <li>Some of the Democrats who have the ultimate super PAC -- they're called the mainstream media.</li>
      <li>How does this guy (Trump), not in one tweet, but in three tweets, misspell words so badly?  I only come to two conclusions. Number one, that&rsquo;s how they spell those words at the Wharton School of Business, where he went, and number two, just like Trump Tower, he must have hired a foreign worker to do his own tweets.</li>
      <li>I think God has blessed us. He&rsquo;s blessed us with some very good candidates. The Democrats can&rsquo;t even find one.</li>
      <li>Bernie Sanders would be a good president, of Sweden.</li>
      <li> Hillary Clintons&rsquo;s first acts as president may very well be to pardon herself.</li>
      <li>Now he's (Trump) repeating himself.</li>
      <li>I saw you (Trump) repeat yourself 5 times 5 seconds ago</li>
      <li>If Trump hadn't inherited $200 million, you know where Donald Trump would be right now? Selling watches in Manhattan.</li>
      <li>If Trump builds a wall the way he built Trump Tower, he'll use illegal immigrants to do it.</li>
      <li>Trump says five things: Everyone's dumb, he's gonna make America great again, we're gonna win, win, win, he's winning in the polls, and the lines around the state.</li>
      <li>It took the telephone 75 years to reach 100 million users. It took 'Candy Crush' one year to reach 100 million users.</li>
      <li>How come Liberals never admit that they&rsquo;re Liberal?  They've now come up with 'Progressive,' which I thought was an Insurance  Company but apparently it&rsquo;s a label.      </li>
      <li>I hate to interrupt this episode of &ldquo;Court TV&quot;</li>
      <li>I like everyone on this stage, none of them are socialists.</li>
      <li>When they're done with the yoga, can I answer a question?</li>
      <li>Well, Trump's very flexible, so you never know.</li>
      <li>Ever done yoga? – No, I&rsquo;m American</li>
      <li>Favorite Democrat? – Uh, next question</li>
      <li>I'm not being politically correct, I'm being correct</li>
    </ol>
