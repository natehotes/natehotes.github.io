    <h1>RIP Marco</h1>
    <p>The year of 2016 has been a rough election year for the Republican Party and therefore America. There has been such a strong anti-establishment movement in our nation that the media and common man have denied any establishment canidate a fair election, and it seems the less rational canidates got the more their poll numbers grow. We, unfortunately, let the people decide and, when the people turn out to be stupid and want a divided nation led by anger over a nation of hope and equality, this is what happens. As Marco said, it was not God's plan for him to win in 2016. Marco and his supporters did all they could, attempting to play the media game with insults and proving the other canidates flaws in policy, but in the end only so much could be done. The good thing about politics is it's like a pendulum, if a &quot;grassroots&quot; canidate goes into the white house and reveals their lack of abilty to lead, in four years the American people will understand why you need someone with experience. I for one am waiting for Rubio 2020, and hope we can stop the forces of hate that divide our country.    <!-- end .content --></p>
